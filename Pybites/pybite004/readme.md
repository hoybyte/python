 Bite 4. Top 10 PyBites tags
In this Bite you will get the top 10 blog tags of our PyBites blog (e.g. python, flask, django, learning).

Our tests suppose you will use a collections.Counter and we loaded a static copy of our feed so we can predictably test your code. The Pybites tags will need to be parsed from this xml feed.

What are the PyBites guys most passionate about? See the tests and you'll know the answer. Then code your solution to make them pass.

Keep calm and code in Python! :)
